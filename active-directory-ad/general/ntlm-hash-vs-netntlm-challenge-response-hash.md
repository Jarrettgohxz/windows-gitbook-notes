# NTLM hash vs NetNTLM challenge-response hash

This page attempts to clarify the differences between the **NetNTLM challenge-response** hash and the **NTLM hash**. Even though the **NTLM hash** is required within the [NetNTLM authentication ](https://jarrettgxz-sec.gitbook.io/penetration-testing-ethical-hacking-concepts/windows-active-directory/initial-access/authentication/netntlm)process, it can be easily confused with the **NetNTLM challenge-response** hash.

### NTLM hash

* A hash stored locally in the user's LSASS or AD database
* The hash can retrieved by a process running locally on the target machine
  * eg. **mimikatz** `lsadump::sam` or `sekurlsa::msv` module
* Commonly used in attacks such as **Pass-the-Hash**

### NetNTLM challenge-response hash

* A hash that is crafted on the fly during the [NetNTLM authentication ](https://jarrettgxz-sec.gitbook.io/penetration-testing-ethical-hacking-concepts/windows-active-directory/initial-access/authentication/netntlm)process, using the user's NTLM hash, along with a challenge from the server
* The hash can be retrieved by intercepting the NetNTLM authentication process
  * when the target sends a response to the challenge generated by the server
* Commonly used in attacks such as NetNTLM challenge offline cracking or challenge relay attacks



Overall, the important concept to note is that the **NTLM hash** is a value required to generate a response to a server's challenge during the NetNTLM authentication process, allowing a machine to authenticate as the user stored in the **NTLM hash**. While the generated response is called the **NetNTLM challenge-response** hash.
