# Security groups vs OUs

While both security groups and OUs are used to classify users and computers, their purposes are entirely different:

_**OUs**_

* Used for applying policies to users and computers, based on specific configurations that applies to their particular role in the organization&#x20;

_**Security groups**_

* Used to grant permissions over resources
* Eg. Grant permission for a group of users to access a shared resource such as a network printer
